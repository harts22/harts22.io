  <p>Kate Wagner opens her essay with, “The internet feeds on its own drying dreams.” 
Which provokes a harsh, but truthful idea that capitalism eats away at nostalgia and turns it into a 
money machine. And while I don’t have much knowledge about the internet’s history or the 
evolution of the interfaces, her essay speaks upon many issues within the internet while giving 
      (at least for me) a much-needed internet history lesson.</p>
    
<p>A notable quote, “the new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats 
away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism.” 
Wanger writes this after saying how she (and other people her age) misses the internet before 
social media. And to begin, it’s a beautiful line. The idea that new things are taken from old 
things and then molds it into a new thing, is “technological cannibalism.” In fashion, or trends in 
general, we see this every year. For example, 90s fashion and older trends have been coming 
back and everyone is buying. It’s this idea that capitalism takes old things, re brands them, and 
    sells them as this new trend.</p> 
    
<p>Wagner brings forth Instagram as her example, she talks about the kitschy gifs to her 
story. How the offerings remind eras from her “online past” like the sparkles that connect her to 
the dress up games or the glitzy text that says “don’t hate me cuz I’m beautiful” from her 
Myspace days. All these are from Giphy, which their aesthetic reminisces older internet days. 
Wagner ends her segment with, “tech companies know that, based on my age, I like them. And I 
    do like them. I miss where they came from—it’s a place I’ve found is no longer there.”</p>
    
<p>Speaking upon, “the hell of beautiful interfaces” this section leans onto the thesis of 
“capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love” which is true. Like Wagner mentions, 
when a website is wiped off the internet, all the data stored is gone with the website. People will 
ask why the company wasn’t profitable and not about the millions of data that had been lost. It’s 
known that companies will say they care about the person, but really, they don’t. They care when 
    there is not a person they can profit from.</p>
    
<p>Now for Vaporwaves, which still not completely knowledgeable on, but 
Afunnylookingsquash on YouTube says that it’s a micro genre started underground on the 
internet. Vaporwave began as an ironic take on chillwave, and it came back when 80s-90s genre 
became popular again or more so that retro style. The cover art or really the aesthetic, uses clip 
art and gifs from the early days of the internet. The neo pastel or muted colors, and images from 
80-90s collaged became a popular way to decorate Tumblr profiles. Wagner presents it as “an 
aesthetic movement dating from the early- to mid-2010s, is a fascinating study in the futility of 
critical artistic movements in the face of contemporary capitalism.” and that is true. Companies 
can take these artistic movements and profit from them, taking this creative and personal 
aesthetic and creating a trend. She ends this section with, “What is not so obvious is the way 
Instagram recycles the original aesthetics, indeed the political ethos, that arose from vaporwave 
and even the early internet itself, into a decontextualized set of images: the internet has become 
    nostalgia in search of a platform.”</p>
    
<p>Wagner’s ending portion is title, “revenge of the old internet” and it’s a perfect header. 
Bigger companies are nothing without nostalgia, because all they do is recycle old things and 
turn them into new ones. Older generations will reminisce, while younger ones will follow 
because it’s this new big internet thing and nostalgia “is profitable—it remains one of the easiest 
    to execute and cheapest grifts of neoliberal culture.”</p> 
    
    <p>And I enjoyed her ending line, “all that is solid melts into air, bitch.”</p>
