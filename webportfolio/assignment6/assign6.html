       <h2>Wild Geese</h2> 
        </header>
        <p>You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.</p>

        <h2>In light of "Wild Geese"</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Mary Oliver, a beautiful poet, begins her poem "Wild Geese" with "you do not have to be good." It's tell people you do not have to be perfect, you do not need to conform into the box that society has placed you in. That you can be like a wild geese who "are heading home again." She encourges people go back to themselves and find solace in the natural world. Another quote that struck me was, "you only need to allow the soft animal of your body love what it loves," you only need to allow yourself to be.</p>
        <p>This poem is my favoirte, epescially from her. Mary Oliver's themes always have nature in mind, and within this poem she uses vivd imagery to convary her messages. Oliver invites there belonging in the "family of things" showing her theme or idea that everyone has a place within the world. It's a comforting poem and one that should be read by everyone. Or even listened to, some poems are better in the voice of the poet and Oliver's readings are outstanding.</p>
